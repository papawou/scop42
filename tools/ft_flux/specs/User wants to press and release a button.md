A button has two states, UP and DOWN

UP means the user doesn't press it
DOWN means the user is pressing it

An user can't press and don't press at the same time

The pressing action means the user do something
But is "doesn't press" it's an action itself ? releasing ?

Is an action imply a reaction ?

Events way ?

an event imply an action in time, an event cause a reaction ? we don't do an event for nothing
this means "an action is an event causing a reaction"

User can ACTION causing REACTION // is state (change) a reaction ?
